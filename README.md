# Google reCAPTCHA

This repository contains a sample code using Google's reCAPTCHA.

Using reCAPTCHA is quite simple:

- Include reCAPTCHA scripts in your webpage
- Tag a button with reCAPTCHA, with `data-sitekey` attribute set
- Have a service receive the request sent from the page
- Add a call to Google's service to check whether that information reCAPTCHA
  sent is valid, and if it is a bot or not.

There is a more complete documentation [here](https://www.google.com/recaptcha).

## Run App
- Run frontend code from root directory
  - `cd frontend`
  - `npm run build && npm run dev`
- Run backend code from root directory
  - `cd backend`
  - `node index.js`

## Quick and dirty

### 1. Add reCAPTCHA script and add a callback function

```html
  <script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    function submitForm(token) {
      document.getElementById("registrationForm").submit();

    }
  </script>
```

Really simple. This code defined a function `submitForm` which will take
whatever element `registrationForm` contains and submit it. The server
(for this example) is defined in the form itself.

### 2. Add a button

```html
  <form action="http://localhost:3000/user" method="POST" id="registrationForm">
    ...
    <button class="g-recaptcha" 
        data-sitekey="YOUR SITE KEY HERE" 
        data-callback='submitForm' 
        data-action='submit'>Submit</button>
  </form>
```

This will create a form and will add a button to it. Notice the `YOUR SITE KEY HERE`
attribute. This should be, your site key.

### 3. Add reCAPTCHA verification to your backend
  
This is simpler than it sound. Basically, send a POST HTTP request to `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify` with data received from the request (by default it should be
`g-recaptcha-response`, but it can have another names. It should be the
token generated by reCAPTCHA library) and your secret key (which you got when
you created the site key). This request should look like this (I'm using axios
here):

```javascript
  const config = {
    method: 'post',
    url: 'https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/siteverify',
    params: {
      secret: "YOUR SECRET KEY HERE",
      response: req.body["g-recaptcha-response"]
    }
  }
  console.log(`Request data: ${util.inspect(config)}`)
  axios(config).then((status) => {
    console.log(`Received response from Google: ${util.inspect(status.data)}`);
    if (data.success === true) {
      res.status(200).send({'message': 'ok'});
    } else {
      res.status(405).send({'message': 'not-allowed'});
    }
  }).catch((error) => {
    console.log(`Received error from Google: ${error}`);
    res.status(500).send({'message': 'error'});
  });
```

Notice that the response contains an attribute `success` which should be the
trigger to let the request be processed (`true` indicates that the service
thinks that the user is a human - poor thing -, `false` it should be a bot).

Docs
https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/choose-key-type ->  Score-based site key (Recommended)

Steps
- I enabled recaptcha enterprise API using steps found here -> https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/set-up-non-google-cloud-environments-api-keys
  https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/recaptchaenterprise.googleapis.com?_ga=2.149945471.831651267.1659344202-1298407974.1659344202

- I created API Key after selecting a project-> ******
  https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=trans-falcon-358109

- I selected Setting up reCAPTCHA Enterprise on non-Google Cloud environments using API Keys as my setup method

I selected the type of reCaptcha keys as per -> https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/keys *Score-based site keys* on *web*

- I created reCaptcha/site keys using the steps here. I added localhost as an allowed domain -> https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/create-key#creating_a_site_key
  https://console.cloud.google.com/security/recaptcha?_ga=2.81392350.831651267.1659344202-1298407974.1659344202&project=trans-falcon-358109
  reCaptcha/site keys -> ******

- I installed score-based site keys (no challenge) on the website using steps here -> https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/instrument-web-pages

Integration
- Integrate the key with the frontend https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/instrument-web-pages#frontend_integration_score
  - Add reCAPTCHA on an HTML button <- Option I used
  - Using deets from https://console.cloud.google.com/security/recaptcha/******/details?project=******
- Assess the reCAPTCHA response token https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha-enterprise/docs/create-assessment
  - Third-party cloud or on-premises that do not support service accounts…..reCAPTCHA Enterprise REST API, using API keys for authentication
  - Verify the reposes using -> https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3
  
  
  I’m sure you must have encountered and been annoyed by the captcha challenges on web pages before. That was the reCAPTCHA v2. In addition to not being very user-friendly, it also increases your page load times. You can partially mitigate this using lazy loading but it is still not the ideal way.

Then came reCAPTCHA v3 which uses machine learning to generate a confidence score based on user/bot interaction with the web page. The lower the score, the lesser the confidence that the interaction is made by a human. Now, this is great because it solves both of the challenges mentioned above. And it is up to you to take actions based on the score. You can choose to block the traffic, enforce 2FA, etc. However, it brings out different types of challenges and limitations:

v3 only generates one of the 4 scores : 0.1, 0.4, 0.7 and 0.9 which is not ideal.
It only tracks user interactions on the particular web page that you integrated it with.
It doesn’t integrate with mobile applications.
Since you have no control over the backend, you can’t tune the model based on your site-specific needs.
Voila!! Here comes reCAPTCHA Enterprise to solve all your problems with more granular confidence scores and ML Model Tuning API, you can mitigate all the challenges from v3 and it provides you with greater control and easy integrations with your mobile apps.
